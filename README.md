# MetaTreeMap
MetaTreeMap (MTM) is a module developed to visualize phylogenic trees where each species (node) has a number of reads (quantity) that map on the reference genome of this species. Each species is represented by a rectangle and its area is proportional to the number of assigned reads. The final figure is nested rectangles representing tree branches.
